# about education

Today our education usually very specific on type of brain process and brain-style activity. For example we spend 4 years on one specializaion in University. Our skill based appoarch is to give freedom in mind usage. Imagine that in school you will work with languages, art, dances, mediation and mind practicies, programming, plants, imagination, body work, work with warm and cold, engineering, singing in individual, in pair and in group. The idea is to learn the techniques of mind usage or how-to-change mind process, you learn style of brain activations and learn howto keep choosed activity as major activity for long time.

# why it's important
Each of as has lot of original mind practices and exercises he/she develop or want to develop. Here you can share it, descibe it and allow other people to connect you practices in constructive way. If you like deep mind processes you will definitly like it.

Each skill have at least four parameters: title, description, frequency and the number (how many times you are going to repeat this experience). 

# how it works

fix mind process and title it
fix the number - how much time you'd like to repeat it
fix the frequency - 1 per hour, 1 per 4 hours, 1 per day or 1 per 3 days or any other frequency
get notifications on trials and see the progress on the website
see your nearest future (1.5 month) based on your current dynamics

share and fork new skills
